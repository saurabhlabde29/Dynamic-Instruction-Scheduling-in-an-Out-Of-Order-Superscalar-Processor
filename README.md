# Dynamic-Instruction-Scheduling-in-an-Out-Of-Order-Superscalar-Processor

Language: C++

• Implemented a cycle-accurate simulator for an out-of-order superscalar processor based on Tomasulo’s algorithm that fetches, dispatches, issues and executes N instructions per cycle. The simulator successfully handled RAW, WAW and WAR hazards.

• Analyzed the variations in Instructions per cycle (IPC) for different superscalar bandwidths and scheduling queue sizes and their tradeoffs.
